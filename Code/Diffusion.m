% We approach this by solving a system of linear equations

%% setting up the Matrix

% We will need to replace some of the entries later to account for
% boundaries.


% this is sort of a tridiagonal matrix, just with 5 diagonals

states = reshape(State', 1, []); %transforms matrix into vector (like x)

% creating the main diagonal of Matrix

% all cells in the right hand boundary
for j=2:M-1
