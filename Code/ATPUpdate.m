function [ATP] = ATPUpdate(params, Glucose, Oxygen, State)
%% Update the ATP matrix with both aerobic and anaerobic processes.

% The following equations can be found on (Smallbone et al., Page 711)

% State : A State matrix of size NxM with entries from 0 to 8
% Glucose : A Glucose matrix of size NxM. \phi_g
% Oxygen : A matrix of size NxM. \phi_c = C = c (because C_X = 1)

% \phi_a = c + n(\phi_g -c) . But here c = C/Cx and Cx = 1.
% Also, n = 2/params.na

% Select glycolytic cells (even state numbers).
mask1 = logical((mod(State,2) == 0) .* (State > 0));

phiGlucose = zeros(params.height, params.width);
phiGlucose = Glucose;
phiGlucose(mask1) = params.k * Glucose(mask1);

phi_h = phiGlucose - Oxygen;
phi_h(State == 0) = 0;

mask2 = phi_h >= 0;

% Implement equation 11
% Select oxygen for all live cells and use phi_h from above to
% update ATP production matrix.
ATP = (Oxygen .* (State ~=0)) + 2/(params.na) * (mask2 .* phi_h);
